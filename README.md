# Mastering Mixology Extended

Fork of [Hexagon's Mastering Mixology plugin](https://github.com/hex-agon/mastering-mixology). All baseline credit goes to the original author; this fork adds multi-reward tracking, paste-quantity goals, Chugging Barrel quantity, an adaptive meta-strategy highlighter, and a full accessibility section (dyslexic / colorblind mode with custom colours for blocks, levers, and progress bars).

### Features
* Appends the potion recipe to the standard minigame interface
* Configurable potion order highlighting strategies
* Station highlighting
* Station quick-action highlighting
* Digweed highlighting & notifications
* Multi-reward tracking with overlay progress bars and a configurable
  notification when your resin pool can afford every selected reward
* **Adaptive meta-strategy highlight** — colours each order green (brew) or
  red (skip) according to a state-machine policy proven near-optimal by
  Monte-Carlo simulation (see below)

### The adaptive meta-strategy in one paragraph

Each turn the plugin classifies the *shape* of your remaining resin deficit
into one of three regimes and applies the sub-policy that is empirically
best for that shape:

* **single-bottleneck** (one colour clearly behind): brew slots that give
  the most-behind colour. If ≥ 2 of the 3 orders give that colour, brew
  all 3 to bank the +40 % bonus.
* **dual-bottleneck** (the top-2 deficit colours are within 20 % of each
  other): only commit to all-3 when ≥ 2 of the orders give *both* of the
  top-2 colours (strict conjunction); otherwise fall back to single-
  bottleneck behaviour.
* **balanced** (all three deficits within 10 % of each other): only brew
  multi-resin potions (no MMM / AAA / LLL); otherwise reroll the best
  single slot.

Transitions use 5 % hysteresis to avoid thrashing
(enter dual at 20 %, leave at 25 %; enter balanced at 10 %, leave at 15 %).
The state is maintained across orders and resets on plugin start-up.

### Why this policy — research notes

The recommendation was derived from a Monte-Carlo simulator that evaluates
order-submission policies across many fixed order sequences. Headline
findings (1 000 trials per policy, all-8-non-pack-reward target of
61 050 mox / 52 550 aga / 70 500 lye):

| Strategy | Mean potions brewed | vs greedy |
|---|---:|---:|
| Adaptive meta (recommended) | 4 612 | −12.8 % |
| Best static (`two_plus_bn`) | 4 606 | −12.9 % |
| Greedy ("brew all 3 every turn") | 5 287 | — |

Caveat: at the standard target shape the meta and the static policy are
**statistically tied** (top-10 variants all within ~20 potions of each
other, p10-p90 spread ~70). The meta wins by a small margin on target
shapes with sharper bottleneck asymmetry and avoids late-game overshoot;
at this particular target, the simpler static rule captures nearly all the
gain on its own.

* The simulator, the supporting policy library (R, ~1 000 trials per
  policy, 20+ candidate policies, a threshold sweep for the meta-policy),
  and the full write-up live in a companion repo:
  [PDBoegel/mastering-mixology-sim](https://github.com/PDBoegel/mastering-mixology-sim).
  See in particular
  [`STRATEGY.md`](https://github.com/PDBoegel/mastering-mixology-sim/blob/main/STRATEGY.md)
  for the methodology, threshold sweep, and verification.
* The static-policy floor was independently verified by a beam search
  exploring up to 200 000 candidate paths per turn on 5 random sequences —
  the beam never beat the policy, which is strong evidence that the meta's
  ~7 502-potion result is near the true minimum on this target.
* The recommended thresholds (20 % / 25 % / 10 % / 15 %) sit in the middle
  of a broad optimum: any sane choice in
  `t_dual_in ∈ [20 %, 50 %], t_balanced_in ∈ [10 %, 20 %], hysteresis ∈
  [2 %, 10 %]` gives essentially the same result. Outside that region
  (e.g. thresholds of 5 % / 2 %) the meta's sub-policy switching is too
  eager and loses ~20 potions.

The highlight uses the *summed cost* of every reward you've ticked in the
Reward Tracking section as the target; turn it off (or untick everything)
to disable. The decision is recomputed on every order rebuild, so toggling
a reward updates the colours immediately.

### Changelog

Entries tagged `V<upstream>-extX.Y` are Extended-fork releases; other
entries are inherited from upstream. `<upstream>` mirrors the upstream
base, `X` bumps on new features, `Y` on ext-only fixes; the ext counter
resets when upstream ships a new version.

#### V1.9.1-ext1.0
First Extended-fork release; baseline upstream v1.9.1.

**Reward tracking**
* Multi-select goal — tick any subset of the ten rewards; overlay shows
  per-resin progress bars and a single notification when the combined
  cost is met.
* Quantity fields for every repeatable reward (packs, aldarium,
  Chugging Barrel).

**Meta-strategy**
* Recommended-Potion Highlight — colours each order green/red per an
  adaptive state-machine policy (Monte-Carlo tuned; see above). Off by
  default; needs at least one reward ticked.

**Accessibility** (new config section)
* Dyslexic / Colorblind Mode — swaps M/A/L letters for colour blocks in
  the order list and inventory tags.
* Configurable recommend/skip text colours (default gold / charcoal).
* Configurable per-resin colours (defaults `#9D4EDD` / `#00FFB3` /
  `#FF6D00`) applied to blocks, inventory tags, lever highlights, and
  progress-bar fills; live re-paint on change.

#### V1.9.1
* Fixed the `Fix Alembic quick-action sound effect` feature to work with the latest RuneLite version

#### V1.9.0
* Added an option to fix the quick-action sound delay on the alembic. This option is enabled by default.
* Internal housekeeping to make the plugin more bulletproof against game updates.

#### V1.8.1
* Fix an issue where the plugin would break the mixology overlay when boosting for better potions 

#### V1.8.0
* New goal tracker feature, use it to track your progress towards the different minigame rewards
* Lowered the potion inventory overlay to make it easier to distinguish finished potions in the inventory

#### V1.7.0
* Fixes stations other than the first in a batch being highlighted even with the config toggled off
* Fixes the vanilla UI enhancement for players that are boosting their herblore levels
* Adds colored inventory tags
* Improves how the `by station` potion order works to prioritize concentrate last to avoid missclicks
* Adds a `shortest past` potion order option

#### V1.6.0
* Adds support for potion order reordering in the interface. For now, the only available options are: Vanilla (default) & By Station type
* Customizable notifications for digweed spawns

#### V1.5.0
* Removal of the potion highlighting strategies, these were conceived when you could only deliver one potion at a time, now it is almost always better to fulfill all orders before delivering.
* Improved quick-action highlighting behavior.
* An option to display the amount of resin you have has been added, it is set to disabled by default.

#### V1.4.1
* Fix repeated potion orders not being marked as fulfilled
* Fix `ready!` indicator when using the `NONE` strategy
* Replaced the `ready!` indicator with `done!`

#### V1.4.0
* Separated quick-action from station highlighting
* Station highlighting is now based on potions in the inventory instead of what you're currently mixing, this should greatly help those who mix multiple potions at the same time
* Added a `ready!` indicator whenever you finish refining a potion that fulfills an order
* Added inventory potion identification similar to the Item Identification plugin, this can be disabled in the plugin settings 

#### V1.3.0
* Added lever highlighting
* Fixed potion experience values

#### V1.2.0
* Fixed a bug where using another station rather than the highlighted would not dismiss it even after delivering the potions
* Fixed a bug where disabling station highlights would still keep them highlighted until fulfilling an order
* Added a strategy to favor the retort station
* Added the option of having no strategy at all, thus not highlighting any potion order
* Changed when stations are highlighted, now the plugin tries to highlight them as soon as you mix a potion order correctly

#### V1.1.0
* Added different configurable potion order strategy highlighting including: Favor experience, Favor alembic station, Favor mox/aga/lye
* Added station highlighting when you pick up a potion
* Added station quick-action highlighting
* Added digweed notifications & highlights
